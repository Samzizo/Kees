## Coded and Designed by Samiha Amroune - Red code ðŸ˜Š 

This prototype project was designed to participate in the Programming Communities Challenge competition in [the One Million Jordanian Coders](https://jordaniancoders.com/) Initiative

This project requires the use of 70% of the programming language to demonstrate the skills acquired in the free course offered by the One Million Jordanian Coders Initiative.

## Theme of the project

** Kees ** Chosen as the main topic of this site due to the spread of poverty, unemployment and destitution due to the Corona pandemic, wars and economic collapse to find an alternative solution to help people move away from financial aid that not everyone may be able to donate.
